# Simple Encryption Algorithm

## Description
- This encryption algorithm is designed to be simple to use
- Uses base64 encoding and then Vigenere cipher
- Takes in files as input

## How to use
- Usage:
  - `python main.py Thisisakey encrypt-me.txt e` --> e for encryption
  - `python main.py Thisisakey decrypt-me.txt d` --> d for decryption

## Key Notes
- This example cipher is made for a class assignment and so is not the most refined it can be
